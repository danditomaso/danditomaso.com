## Project Overview
I developed an interactive web application to simulate the famous Monty Hall probability puzzle. This project was completed as a fun, one-day challenge to demonstrate rapid prototyping skills and create an engaging user experience around a classic statistical problem.

### Key Features
- **Interactive Simulation**: Users can play through the Monty Hall problem, making choices and seeing results in real-time.
- **Sleek, Dark-Themed UI**: Implemented a modern, visually appealing interface with a dark theme and purple accents for enhanced user engagement.
- **Game Statistics**: Real-time tracking and display of game outcomes to help users understand the probabilities involved.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensured a seamless experience across various device sizes.
- **Educational Component**: Included a welcome dialog explaining the rules and concept of the Monty Hall problem.

### Technologies Used
- **Next.js**: Leveraged for its powerful React framework and server-side rendering capabilities.
- **React**: Utilized for building a dynamic and interactive user interface.
- **TypeScript**: Implemented for enhanced code quality and type safety.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Employed for rapid, utility-first styling and consistent design.
- **shadcn/ui**: Integrated for high-quality, accessible UI components.

### Development Highlights
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Completed the entire project in just one day, showcasing efficient development skills.
- **State Management**: Implemented complex game logic and state management using React hooks.
- **UI/UX Design**: Created an intuitive and visually appealing interface to make a statistical concept more accessible and engaging.
- **Accessibility**: Ensured the application was keyboard-navigable and screen-reader friendly.

### Challenges and Solutions
- **Probability Logic**: Accurately implemented the counterintuitive probability mechanics of the Monty Hall problem.
- **User Guidance**: Designed clear instructions and visual cues to guide users through the game process.
- **Performance Optimization**: Ensured smooth animations and transitions despite the rapid development timeline.

## Outcome
This project demonstrates my ability to quickly conceptualize, design, and implement a fully functional web application. It showcases my skills in modern web technologies, my understanding of user experience design, and my capacity to explain complex concepts through interactive digital means.

### Future Enhancements
While completed in a day, the project has potential for further development:
- Implementing an automated simulation mode for running multiple games.
- Adding more detailed statistical analysis and visualizations.
- Creating shareable results for social media integration.

This Monty Hall Simulator project encapsulates my passion for combining education with technology, all while adhering to best practices in web development and user interface design.
