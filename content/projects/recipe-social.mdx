# Recipe Social

Recipe Social is an ambitious project aimed at transforming the recipe discovery and cooking experience. By focusing on streamlining the often cluttered and advertisement-heavy nature of traditional recipe websites, this platform promises a more efficient cooking journey for users.

## Project Overview
- **Concept**: A clean, user-focused recipe platform that eliminates the clutter common on recipe websites.
- **Tech Stack**: TypeScript, Next.js, Go, PostgreSQL
- **Status**: Currently on pause while the developer contributes to the Meshtastic ecosystem

## My Thoughts
This project addresses a genuine pain point in the cooking content space. Most recipe websites are notorious for excessive storytelling, intrusive ads, and poor user experience. Recipe Social appears to take a more user-centric approach that prioritizes efficient access to cooking information.

The technology choices demonstrate a modern, scalable approach:
- **Next.js frontend**: Provides excellent performance and SEO capabilities
- **Go backend**: Offers speed and efficiency for API operations
- **PostgreSQL**: We need a solution that is a modern and reliable choice for structured data storage

While currently paused, the concept has significant potential in a market where users are increasingly looking for streamlined digital experiences. The decision to temporarily focus on open source contributions to Meshtastic shows an admirable commitment to community-driven development.

## Future Potential
If development resumes, Recipe Social could differentiate itself by:
- Implementing AI-assisted recipe scaling and substitutions
- Creating a distraction-free cooking mode
- Focusing on accessibility features often overlooked by competitors
- Building community features that avoid the common pitfalls of social platforms

This project represents an interesting intersection of practical utility and improved user experience in a space that desperately needs innovation.
