# Overview

My portfolio is a reflection of who I am as a developer—clean, professional, and focused on creating meaningful user experiences. It showcases the work I’ve done, from building intuitive, high-performing applications to designing accessible, user-centric interfaces. Every project highlights my expertise with modern tools like TypeScript, React, and Go, along with my commitment to both functionality and design. I’ve put a lot of thought into the layout and navigation, making sure it’s as polished and straightforward as the applications I build.
