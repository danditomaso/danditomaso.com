# Open Source Maintainer 

I am one of the maintainers of the Meshtastic Web Client helping to bring mesh networking accessibility to browsers everywhere. I work to ensure that users can configure, monitor, and interact with their Meshtastic devices through a seamless web interface without requiring dedicated apps.

### What I Do
- Lead development efforts for the Meshtastic WebClient 
- Implement new features that align with the core Meshtastic project goals
- Ensure cross-browser compatibility and responsive design
- Triage issues and review community contributions
- Maintain documentation for developers and end-users

### Technical Focus
- TypeScript development of new features, including resolving reported user issues
- Triaging feature requests to ensure they align with the projects goals 
- Building out the functionality of the TypeScript SDK which is heavily used by the WebClient 
- Being active in the project chat answer questions and providing developer outreach

### Community Engagement
I believe in the power of open mesh networks to connect people in scenarios where traditional infrastructure fails. When I'm not coding, I'm engaging with the Meshtastic community, helping new users get started, attending local ham radio club meetings and collaborating with other maintainers to build a more resilient communication ecosystem.
